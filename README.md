# NP StudentTOMS Generator 6.2
Tired of entering your student credentials every time you enter NP?
Be tired no more!

With StudentTOMS Generator 6.2, just enter your credentials once and they will be saved to local storage.
For recurring visits, just click on the TOMS link below the form.

Admittedly, the form design isn't good and the code is probably kinda messy, but hey it works.

# Motivation
I always waste a good 1-2 minutes when entering school to fill out this form.
Sometimes, I also block other people's way when I take too long to enter my details.
Imagine if you're running late, you can save some time and maybe, hopefully be on time for class!

I made this as a small distraction from school, sigh.
